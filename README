This is a fork of the original BeanstalkClient by jpeffer. It makes the following
changes:

- Fixes file formats to be Unix.
- Add full comments to interfaces (and some to implementations).
- Fix formatting.
- Add build.xml file for Ant.
- Always use blocking IO so that binary payloads can be used.
- Convert unchecked exceptions to checked exceptions.

I do not push my version to Maven Central.

This is JavaBeanstalkClient, a Java Client for beanstalkd

See http://xph.us/software/beanstalkd for general info

To build JavaBeanstalkClient, type "mvn install"

This client library is designed to operate with other client libraries; 
hence jobs are opaque byte arrays, job ids require the use of a Java long (to support 
unsigned ints up to 2**32), etc. 

The implementation of the library is based upon the design of the Python beanstalkc at
http://github.com/earl/beanstalkc/tree/master

Documentation on how to use Beanstalkd is available at
http://github.com/kr/beanstalkd/tree/v1.3/doc/protocol.txt?raw=true
and
